Taken from [TheKitchn](https://www.thekitchn.com/hawaiian-butter-mochi-recipe-23147549). Based on/in the family of Hawaiian style butter mochi. I also have a scribbled note to check [the pancake princess best butter mochi bake-off](https://www.thepancakeprincess.com/best-butter-mochi-bake-off/) which is a cool comparison of different types of butter mochi!

## Ingredients

- 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter
- 1 lb mochiko flour - we used glutinous rice flour and it still worked out great!

- 2 teaspoons baking powder

- 2 cups milk, any fat percentage
- 4 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 can (~13.5 ounces) unsweetened coconut milk
- 1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
- a few pinches of falky salt to top

## Steps

- Preheat oven to 350 F
- Coat a 9x13-inch baking pan with butter or oil
- Melt the stick of butter in the microwave
- Mix drys: mochiko, sugar, baking powder, salt
- Mix wets in a different bown: milk, eggs, vanilla extract
- Add wet to dry and stir well. Then add butter and shredded coconut.
