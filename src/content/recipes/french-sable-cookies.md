Taken from [An Italian in my Kitchen](https://anitalianinmykitchen.com/sable-cookies/). Makes a really nice cookie for tea!

## Ingredients

- 1 cup salted butter softened
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1 pinch salt (if you use unsalted butter then add 1/4 teaspoon of salt)
- 2 egg yolks (room temperature)
- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
- Extra Egg Wash
  - 1 medium egg
  - 1 tablespoon milk
  - 1/4 - 1/3 cup sparkling or granulated sugar

## Steps

- In a big bowl
  - cream the butter
  - then add the sugars and salt
  - Add egg yolks and vanila
- Make sure it's all well combined and scrape the bowl
- Add the flour in 3 additions
- Mix the dough until just combined
- Place the dough on a lightly floured surface
  - knead gently into a ball
  - separate the dough into 2 parts
  - They can be a log to cut into rounds or a ball to shape later
  - Wrap the dough in plastic and fridge for at least 3 hours
- Remove the dough from the fridge
- For the log
  - Brush with egg wash
  - sprinkle with sparking sugar
  - cut into 1/3" slices
  - place on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet
- For cut out cookies
  - Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface
  - Not too thin, this will make the cookies delicate and burn more easily
  - Cut out your with favorite cookie cuters :)
  - Place the cut outs on a parchement lined cookie sheet
  - Sprinkle with sparkling sugar or granulated sugar
  - No egg wash needed
- Refrigerate the cookies again while the oven is pre-heating at 325F (160C)
- Once the oven is ready bake the cookies 15-17 minutes or until the cookies are light brown on the bottom and lightly golden around the edges but still pale on top
- After 2-3 minutes carefully remove the cookies with a metal spatula from the cookie sheet and carefully place a wire rack to cool completely
